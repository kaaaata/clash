This is the codebase for "Clash", a React card game I developed. "Clash" borrows ideas from Clash of the Dragons, an old browser card game I played as a kid, but has since closed down.  

This repo is meant to render a 1000px x 600px game and nothing else, so that it can be embedded as an iframe inside my main website, [www.kaaaata.com](http://www.kaaaata.com)  

## Bootstrapping Instructions
<code>npm i</code> install dependencies  
<code>npm start</code> to start the React app at [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)  

## useful package.json scripts
<code>npm run lint</code> run lint excluding rules in .eslintrc  
<code>npm t</code> run Jest test suite

## Additionally...
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
